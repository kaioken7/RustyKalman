Implementation of Kalman Filter using Rust
Kalman FIlter is being used in Large Hadron Collider for measuring the precision of particle trajectory by their energy so in order to do that it uses sensors which registers their tracking whenever they are being hit by a particle.
In this Project, We are going to Implement the working of the process by using RUST programming language.
We are about to use "Affine vector transformation" from 3D global projections to their corresponding 2D cartesian points.
